Miti is a minimal Nepali Calendar App that can sync with your Google account and can be installed on any operating system as a progressive web app. 

It is completely open-source and free to use without any ads. But why did we create yet another Nepali Calendar App when there are already so many of them? Two main reasons, they’re too bloated and they fail to become a good calendar, i.e. to cross-compatibility with other calendars. Miti can be operated in sync with native calendar apps in any OS because almost all of them support google calendar.
